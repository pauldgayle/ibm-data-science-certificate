# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Repository

Hello! My name is Paul Gayle, and this is the repository where all my projects towards my IBM Data Science Certificate

The IMB Data Science Professional Certificate has taught me the tools, languages, and libraries used by professional data scientists, including Python and SQL. With this knowledge, I've been able to import and clean data sets, analyze and visualize data, and build machine learning models and pipelines. I plan to apply these skills in real-qorld projects, such as my final capstone, which is using classification systems to determine top charting games on Steam based on their categories (coming soon!) 

While courses 1-5 were helpful, the subjects taught and projects submitted are easily reflected in the following course finals, 6-9.

## Here are the projects attached to this repository, and the methods learned and used within each course
Course 6:
-  I analyzed data within a database using SQL and Python to create a relational database and work with multiple tables using DDL commands. I then learned and utilized basic to intermediate level SQL queries to compose more powerful queries with advanced SQL techniques like views, transactions, stored procedures, and joins.

Course 7:
- I analyzed real-world datasets through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy to uncover patterns and insights. With this knowledge, I applied data operation techniques using dataframes to organize, summarize, and interpret data distributions, correlation analysis, and data pipelines to generate predictions and support data-driven decision-making.

Course 8:
- I implemented data visualization techniques and plots using Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to tell a stimulating story. These data visualization techniques range from creating different types of charts and plots (line, area, histograms, bar, pie, box, scatter, bubble), advanced visualizations (waffle charts, word clouds, regression plots, maps with markers, choropleth maps) and interactive dashboards using the Dash framework and Plotly library (scatter, line, bar, bubble, pie).

Course 9:
- I learned and appplied core machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction using Python and scikit-learn. I then evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics, validation strategies, and optimization techniques.
