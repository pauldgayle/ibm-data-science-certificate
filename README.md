# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Repository

Hello! My name is Paul Gayle, and this is the repository where all my projects towards my IBM Data Science Certificate

The IMB Data Science Professional Certificate has taught me the tools, languages, and libraries used by professional data scientists, including Python and SQL. With this knowledge, I've been able to import and clean data sets, analyze and visualize data, and build machine learning models and pipelines. I plan to apply these skills in real-qorld projects, such as my final capstone, which is using classification systems to determine top charting games on Steam based on their categories (coming soon!) 

While courses 1-5 were helpful, the subjects taught and projects submitted are easily reflected in the following course finals, 6-9.
